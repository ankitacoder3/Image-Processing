# Image-Processing
###
###
###

## Summary:
#### In this project several image processing techniques are used. These techniques also include various filters like median filter, gaussian filter, linear filter, etc... . Some of the other techniques implemented here are scaling, cropping, rotation etc... .
###
###

## Objective:
##### ==> To transform an image to implement techniques, like image rotation, cropping, image smoothening, filters etcâ€¦
##### ==> The techniques mentioned above are implemented using concepts such as linear transformation and SVD
###
###

## The features of this project are as follows:

  ##### -> In this project image processing techniques are implemented
  ##### -> Image processing involves manipulating images at a time and extracts useful insights from them.
  ##### -> Image can be represented as a grid of n x n small pieces, which are called pixels. 
  ##### -> If we can assign numbers to each colour, then, the grid of pixels can be represented as a numerical matrix.
  ###
  
  ##### -> Techniques implemented are:
  ##### *a. filters:- gaussian filter, median filter, linear filter, etc...*
  ##### *b. transformation techniques (or techniques):- cropping, scaling, rotation, grayscaling, etc...*
  ###
  ##### -> Concepts used are:  
  ##### *Linear transformation, SVD, Fourier transformations*
  ###
  ##### -> The language used to implement these is:  *Python*
  ###

## Contents in the repository:

##### ---> In the 'Image_Processing' Directory there are 4 directories:
#####   i- "Images" Directory- contains all the Images used in the programs.
#####   ii- "Individual_Filters&Techniques" Directory- contains the techniques and filters implemented separately.
#####   iii- "All_Filters_Combined" Directory- contains one program for the techniques and filters combined.
#####   iv- "Extra_Contents" Directory- contains extra information about the techniques and filters used.

 ###
 
## Steps for execution:

  #### 1. Clone the 'Image-Processing' github repository.
  #### 2. Navigate to the 'Image_Processing' Directory in that.
  #### 3. Navigate to the 'Individual_Filters&Technique' Directory to execute techniques and filters separately; By opening any file in python idle and running it.
  #### 4. Navigate to the 'All_Filters_Combined' Directory to execute the techniques and filters combined; By opening any file in python idle and running it.
  #### 5. Navigate to the 'Extra_Contents' Directory to find extra information about the filters and techniques.
  ###
  ###### Note- For some filters and techniques information may not be complete or it may not exist in the'Extra_Contents' Directory.
