## Introduction
In the project ```IMG-IMPACT ``` several    ```Image Processing``` techniques are used. 

These techniques also include various ```filters``` like median filter, gaussian filter, linear filter, etc... 

Other techniques implemented here are ```scaling```, ```cropping```, ```rotation``` etc... 

</br>

* Contents :

  In the ```IMG-IMPACT``` Directory there are 4 directories:
  
  - ```Images``` Directory- contains all the Images used in the programs.
  - ```Individual_Filters&Techniques``` Directory- contains the techniques and filters implemented separately.
  - ```All_Filters_Combined``` Directory- contains one program for the techniques and filters combined.
  - ```Extra_Contents``` Directory- contains extra information about the techniques and filters used.

* Features:

    - In this project image processing techniques are implemented
    - Image processing involves manipulating images at a time and extracts useful insights from them.
    - Image can be represented as a grid of n x n small pieces, which are called pixels. 
    - If we can assign numbers to each colour, then, the grid of pixels can be represented as a numerical matrix.

<!--
## Objective
* To transform an image to implement techniques, like image rotation, cropping, image smoothening, filters etc
* The techniques mentioned above are implemented using concepts such as linear transformation and SVD

## Steps for Execution

  1. Clone the 'Image-Processing--IMG-IMPACT' github repository.
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/ankitacoder3/Image-Processing--IMG-IMPACT.git
      ```
 2. Navigate to the 'IMG-IMPACT' Directory in that.
    ```sh
    cd Image-Processing--IMG-IMPACT
    cd IMG-IMPACT
    ```

  3. Navigate to the 'Individual_Filters&Technique' Directory to execute techniques and filters separately; By opening any file in python idle and running it.
4. Navigate to the 'All_Filters_Combined' Directory to execute the techniques and filters combined; By opening any file in python idle and running it.
 5. Navigate to the 'Extra_Contents' Directory to find extra information about the filters and techniques.
    Note- For some filters and techniques information may not be complete or it may not exist in the'Extra_Contents' Directory.

## Usage

* IMG-IMPACT application can transform the pictures, given as input, into different variations of the same picture.

  
* IMG-IMPACT application has many filters like linear filter, median filter etc.

  
* IMG-IMPACT application also has operations such as rotating, cropping the image.

  
* IMG-IMPACT can be used to create new images, from the old images.
